First attempt at a simple laser defender game.

Currently in the one unlimited level you fight enemies that fly across the screen with your main attack (Spacebar).
There are three different types of enemies that will attack you, you are supposed to avoid them (W,A,S,D).
The enemies come in different patterns, packs and paths, more of both can be added through the configuration.
Using Unity engine and c# with assets taken from kennysprites at https://www.kenney.nl/assets.
No win condition currently, you get points for destroying enemies. 
Get as many points as possible before your ship takes too much damage.
The different enemies deal different amounts of damage, while a collision results in instant death.
